# Python Practices - Assignment 1

A collection of introductory Python scripts demonstrating basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and string manipulation. This project serves as a foundation for understanding Python syntax and best practices.

## Features

- **Task 1 (Calculator)**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) with error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- **Task 2 (Greeting)**: accepts user input for names and generates a personalized greeting message using string formatting.
- **Clean Code**: Follows PEP8 standards with meaningful variable names, docstrings, and modular structure.
- **Error Handling**: gracefully manages invalid user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Concepts**: Variables, Data Types, Input/Output, F-strings, Exception Handling, Control Structures.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[Your_Username]/Python-Practices.git
   cd "Python Practices/Assignment_1"
   ```

3. **Run Task 1 (Calculator)**:

   ```bash
   python task_1.py
   ```

4. **Run Task 2 (Greeting)**:
   ```bash
   python task_2.py
   ```

## Sample Output

**Task 1:**

```text
Enter the value of a: 10
Enter the value of b: 5
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0
```

**Task 2:**

```text
Enter your first name: Jane
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello Jane Doe, Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
```

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, I have practiced:

- Writing clean, readable, and well-structured Python code.
- Handling user input and type conversion.
- Implementing basic logic and mathematical operations.
- formatting strings using Python's f-strings.
- Using `try-except` blocks for basic error handling.
